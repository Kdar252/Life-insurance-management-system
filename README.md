The Life Insurance Management Database System is a project designed to provide efficient and secure management of life insurance policies. 
It aims to streamline the processes involved in the administration, tracking, and retrieval of policy information.

Life Insurance Policy data management system is a web based project which is 
developed for tracking the details of the insurance policy, customer details and company details. 
My SQL was used to handle data. 
Functions were implimented to classify the policies based on their status whether they are active, lapsed, matured, etc. 
According to those classifications, different tables are created in the database and according to functions, records
are grouped in respective tables. The features contain management of clients, agents, policy,
payment transactions, nominees and users can view their own personal details through the login and
logout feature. XAMPP software is used to connect .php files and the database on a local server.
